<h2>Skill Evidence</h2>
<p>I have three objectives for my Skill.
<ol>1. Learn to write HTML</ol>
<ol>2. Learn to create a static website with CI/CD pipeline</ol>
<ol>3. Learn to store and manage source code on Github</ol>
  
<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
Upcoming activities I am planning to do:
  <ol>Complete Github tutorial</ol>
  <ol>Use Git commandline to make copy of Master and push changes</ol>
  <ol>Plan improvements to the site</ol>
  <ol>Rewrite the site page in Markdown</ol>
   <ol>Resize theimages</ol>

<h3>22nd December 2020</h3>
  <ol>Site updates as usual</ol>
  <ol>Tweaked CSS to change image size</ol>
    
    <p>Getting harder but more interesting. Frustrations are (a) motivation and (b) slow updates of Github Pages after I make a change and (c) the fiddliness of HTML</p>
    
<h3>29th November 2020</h3>
  <ol>Site updates</ol>
  <ol>Add some css to change the way the site looks</ol>
   <ol>Reflect on site so far</ol>
  
<p> So far the site has been a somewhat challenging experience (mainly to begin with) and I am now at a stage where I can confidently make and maintain a basic website. Due to the lack of spell check, spelling has also been a issue.</p>
  
  <p>Looking forward I would I would like to find away to automate the uploading of runs to the website from strava so I can cut back on time it takes to maintain</p>
  <p>I would also like to find away of editing the raw text that is a bit more natural</p>

<h3>22nd November 2020</h3>
<p>Today I continued using  HTML code for a website. My objectives for today are: </p>
<ol>1. Update the website</ol>
<ol>2. Transfer updated file to GitHub</ol>
<ol>3. Serve the HTML file through GitHub Pages</ol>
<h3>15th November 2020</h3>
<p>Today I began learning to code using HTML. I understand it better now. </p>

<h2>Volunteering Evidence</h2>
<p>I will be collecting litter in local parks. This is a 3 month volunteering segment for me and will begin in February once I have finished the Skill phase. (Although I will need to keep going with the Skill to keep this page updated with the Volunteering evidence.)</p>
